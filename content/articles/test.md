Hey Rohan, awesome experience. I just want to know after doing this
certification how it changes your career in any good direction or how
this certification effects your android developer career (jobs) or
anything.Because i have did the certification August this year. i have 2
years of exp in android development. And it didn't seem to give much
effect to my resume upto now. SO Any advice or anything i might have
been doing wrong. Thanks.
